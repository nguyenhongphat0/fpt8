        <summary type="html">Arena of Evolution, the Auto Chess rip-off that soft launched on Android recently, has reportedly rolled out in more territories. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be a full global release but players in America and Germany are reporting that it&#8217;s available in their countries now. Arena of Evolution is basically Auto Chess on mobile If you haven&#8217;t heard of this yet, it&#8217;s a new strategy game that draws an awful lot of inspiration from Auto Chess. That&#8217;s a Dota spin-off in which you set all of your strategical options before the battle and then watch it play out. It&#8217;s pretty novel. There are over 60 heroes to collect here, all of which you can upgrade to increase their power or simply customise their play style. If you&#8217;d like to check it out, it&#8217;s available in certain territories right now on Google Play. As ever, please let us know in the comments section below if you can or can&#8217;t get it so the audience has a good idea of where it&#8217;s available.</summary>
